# NIST-TN-1951-AI

This repository contains AI-related work utilizing the NIST 1951 industrial wireless propagation measurements. The project focuses on applying artificial intelligence techniques to analyze and model industrial wireless propagation data.

## About

The NIST-TN-1951-AI project leverages the NIST 1951 dataset to develop AI-driven approaches for understanding and simulating industrial wireless environments. The dataset includes RF propagation measurements from various industrial settings, available at [http://doi.org/10.18434/T44S3N](http://doi.org/10.18434/T44S3N).
